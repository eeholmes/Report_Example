    "text": "Two Rocks Marine Park is part of the South-west Regional Management Network of the Australian Marine Parks system. The selected National Park Zone (NPZ) (swtwonpz02) represents a relatively shallow coastal habitat with a bottom type primarily consisting of calcareous sand and gravel (Lucieer et al. 2017). Recorders were deployed at two sites within the NPZ—Two Rocks East (TRE) and Two Rocks West (TRW)—to maximize coverage of the monitoring area (Table 1, Fig. 1).",
